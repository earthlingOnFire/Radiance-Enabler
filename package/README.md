WHAT DOES THIS MOD DO?
- This mod allows you to enable and disable full radiance through Configgy.
- Although you don't need to enable cheats beforehand, they will be enabled the moment you turn radiance on, even if the Cheats Menu is hidden.

HOW DO I INSTALL THIS MOD MANUALLY?
- Install BepInEx and Configgy. Once they are installed, all you need to do is drag RadianceEnabler.dll to BepInEx/plugins inside your game files.

> [!NOTE]
> Enabling radiance with "buffs forceradiance on" will not work when this mod is installed.
