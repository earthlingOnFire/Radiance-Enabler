# What does this mod do?
- This mod allows you to enable and disable full radiance through Configgy.
- You can also make enemies only visually radiant.
- Although you don't need to enable cheats beforehand, they will be enabled the moment you turn radiance on, even if the Cheats Menu is hidden.

# Manual Installation
Install BepInEx and Configgy. Once they are installed, all you need to do is drag the RadianceEnabler folder (or the RadianceEnabler.dll file inside) to BepInEx/plugins inside your game files.

# NOTE
Enabling radiance with "buffs forceradiance on" will not work when this mod is installed.
